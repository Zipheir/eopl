# Exercise 3.13

Now, integers are the only expressed values, doing double duty as
boolean (0 is falsy, everything else is truthy).

See src/let-ints-only.scm.  The only significant change is in the
semantics of if-exps:

(value-of (if-exp exp₁ exp₂ exp₃) ρ) =
  (if (zero? (expval->num (value-of exp₁ ρ)))
      (value-of exp₃ ρ)
      (value-of exp₂ ρ))
