# Exercise 4.23

Read statements for the Ex. 4.22 language (BASICALLY).

Statement ::= read Identifier
              [read-stmt var]

The semantics hide some details, obviously:

                    (I/O) = val₁
----------------------------------------------------
 (result-of (read-stmt var) ρ σ) = [ρ(var) = val₁]σ

See the basically-ext branch for an implementation.
