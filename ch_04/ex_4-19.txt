# Exercise 4.19

This adapts the IMPLICIT-REFS interpreter to use the Ex. 3.35/3.36
"box trick" for constructing rec environments.

The only real difference between the situations here and in Ex. 3.36
is that locations have to be allocated for the procedure values.  I
can use the 3.36 implementation of extend-env-rec, except that the
value put in the box is now a location:

(vector-set! vec
             0
             (newref
              (make-proc-val
               (procedure var body new-env))))

I'll also need to unbox values retrieved from environments, but that's
straightforward.
