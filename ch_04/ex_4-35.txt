# Exercise 4.35

This adds a 'ref' form to IMPLICIT-REFS.

Expression ::= ref Identifier
               [ref-exp (var)]

The value of a ref expression is a reference to the location denoted
by the given variable.  Since this provides a way to get references as
values in this language, the expressed values change:

Exp-val = Int + Bool + Proc + Ref(Exp-val)

The example for this exercise shows additional infrastructure for
working with reference values, namely deref and setref expressions.
The semantics for these are basically the same as they were in the
earlier language.

Here's the rule for ref:

-----------------------------------------
 (value-of (ref-exp (var)) ρ σ) = ρ(var)
