# Exercise 4.20

Mutable and immutable variables:

Exp-val = Int + Bool + Proc
Den-val = Ref(Exp-val) + Exp-val

New syntax:

Expression ::= letmutable Identifier = Expression in Expression

Immutable variables are introduced by let expressions.

The existing let expressions of IMPLICIT-REFS are exactly the
letmutable expressions of the new language.  All that's missing,
then, are the (immutable-binding) let expressions:

     (value-of exp₁ ρ σ₀) = (val₁, σ₁)
-------------------------------------------
 (value-of (let-exp var exp₁ body) ρ σ₀) =
   (value-of body [var = val₁]ρ σ₁)

Additional checking of denoted values may be in order, since
they now come in two flavors.
