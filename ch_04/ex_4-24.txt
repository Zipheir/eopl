# Exercise 4.24

This adds a do-while form to BASICALLY.

Expression ::= do Statement while Expression
               [do-while-exp body test]

This form is very awkward to specify in something like a denotational
style (and, like while, its spec. isn't compositional), so here's an
interpreter fragment:

(result-of (do-while-exp body test) env) =
  (let loop ()
    (result-of body env)
    (when (expval->bool (value-of test env))
      (loop)))
