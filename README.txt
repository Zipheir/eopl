# Essentials of Programming Languages

This repo contains my notes and work on Essentials of Programming
Languages, 3rd Ed. by Dan Friedman & Mitch Wand.

## Language

The Scheme implementations are opinionated, and don't use the book's
favorite datatype framework.  (The early exercises use R6RS records,
but I quickly got tired of all that extra typing.)  Instead, they use
tagged lists and the tiny pmatch pattern matcher (by Oleg Kiselyov,
touched up by Will Byrd) for typed data.  SICP enthusiasts should
find this kind of thing familiar.

## Contact

Feel free to contact me if you find any of this useful or interesting.
This is a very fun book, and worth discussing.
