# Exercise 4.18

Trying to use the original type-of-application from CHECKED causes
inference to fail in some cases, when the algorithm is not able to
fully determine the type of the operator of an application.  Here's
an example that breaks:

(proc ((f . ?)) (proc ((x . int)) (zero? (f x))))

This should be given the type ((int -> int) -> bool), but the type
variable assigned to 'f' is not filled in when typing the (f x)
call.  Thus, inference breaks with an "invalid operator" error,
since it's an empty box.

So it's vital that the rator-type gets unified against the actual
parameter types, as in the reworked version of type-of-application.
