# Exercise 6.21

To produce code that evaluates operands before the operator in a
call expression, I can change cps-of-call-exp as follows:

(define (cps-of-call-exp rator rands k-exp)
  (cps-of-exps
   (append rands (list rator))
   (lambda (sms)
     (cps-call-exps
      (last sms)
      (append (init sms) (list k-exp))))))

(This assumes that cps-of-exps is still producing LR code.)
