# Exercise 2.9

Interface:

                         ⎧ #t  if var ∈ preimage(f)
(has-binding? ⌈f⌉ var) = ⎨
                         ⎩ #f  otherwise

This spec is a little awkward.  Is there a better way to express it
than in terms of the preimage of the environment?

The concise alist implementation:

;; has-binding? : Env × Var → Bool
(define (has-binding? env var)
  (and (assv var env) #t))
