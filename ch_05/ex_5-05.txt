# Exercise 5.5

Lists for the CPS LETREC interpreter.  The operations are all familiar,
and their translations to CPS are pretty obvious.  Lists are
represented internally as List-of(Exp-val) values.

cons is the only one complex enough to bother describing here; for the
rest, see src/letrec-cont.scm.

;; (value-of/k exp env cont) ...
(cons-exp (car-exp cdr-exp)
  (value-of/k car-exp env (cons-car-cont cdr-exp env cont)))

The continuations:

;; cons-car-cont
(apply-cont (cons-car-cont cdr-exp env cont) val)
  = (value-of/k cdr-exp env (cons-cdr-cont val cont))

;; cons-cdr-cont
(apply-cont (cons-cdr-cont car-val cont) val)
  = (apply-cont cont (list-val (cons car-val (expval->list val))))

Note that the environment is not needed to actually build the list,
so it's dropped from the cdr continuation.
