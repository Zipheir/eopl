# Exercise 5.4

let3 is very much like let2 with an additional evaluation
continuation for the third binding.  This continuation has the
following spec.:

(apply-cont (let3-exp3-cont var1 val1 var2 val2 var3 body env cont)
            val3)
  = (value-of/k body
                (extend-env var3
                            val3
                            (extend-env var2
                                        val2
                                        (extend-env var1
                                                    val1
                                                    env)))
                cont)

Clearly this form is a bit ungainly.
