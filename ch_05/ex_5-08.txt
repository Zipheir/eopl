# Exercise 5.8

Multi-arg procedures for the CPS interpreter are very similar to
multi-arg let (ex. 5.7).  I make the usual changes to the procedure
representation and to the parser.  The adjustments to the interpreter
are all minor, except for rator-cont, which becomes:

(apply-cont (rator-cont rand env cont) val1)
  = (eval-list/k rands env (rands-cont val1 cont))

The rest is basically the same.
