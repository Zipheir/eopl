# Exercise 5.11

begin expressions for the CPS IMPLICIT-REFS interpreter.  This is
pure control:

;; (value-of/k exp env cont)
(begin-exp (exps)
  (if (null? exps)
      (apply-cont cont the-unspecifie-value)
      (value-of/k (car exps)
                  env
                  (seq-rest-cont (cdr exps) env cont))))

The continuation is specified by

(apply-cont (seq-rest-cont exps env cont) val)
  = (if (null? exps)
        (apply-cont cont val)
        (value-of/k (car exps)
                    env
                    (seq-rest-cont (cdr exps) env cont)))

Note that the null? checks serve different purposes; begin expressions
evaluate to the-unspecified-value just in the case when there are no
subexpressions.  In every other case, they return the value of the
last subexpression.
