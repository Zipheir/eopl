# Exercise 5.42

This adds letcc to the exceptions interpreter.  The syntax:

Expression ::= letcc Identifier in Expression

The spec.:

(value-of/k (letcc-exp var body) env cont))
  = (value-of/k body (extend-env var (cont-val cont) env) cont)

Once a continuation has been bound to a variable with letcc, it
can be applied with a throw expression (see Ex. 5.40).

This is very straightforward to add; the above change to value-of/k
is pretty much all we need.
